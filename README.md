# MEMT680-
For Class Midterm

The code written for the midterm is expected to play the game of craps.

The code is supposed to ask the user if thwy would like to start a bet. It will ask for their name and bankroll.

Afterwards, it will ask the user if they would like to make a bet on the pass or don't pass line.

The code will then roll the dice and determine the outcome of the bet after the point has been set.

The code will tell the player if they won or lost, and if they would like to continue to play.

Thank you for your time.
