# Create a game of Craps in Python

# I want the code to do the following:
#  Define a class for Dice
class Dice:  # Defines the class
    pass  # passes when called
    def __init__(self, die1, die2, total):
        self.die1 = random.randint(1,6);
        self.die2 = random.randint(1,6);
    
    def roll():
      return(die1 + die2)

roll_1 = roll()
print(roll_1)




# The Dice has a method Roll
# Define a class for Table
# The Table will inherit the Dice
# The Table will have a state Point
# Define a class for Player
# Player will inherit from the Table
# At initialization, ask the user to input a name for Player
# Ask the player for bankroll (money on the table)
# Only allow user to make bets in dollars
# The script tells the player they can’t have a bankroll that can’t be converted to dollars
# Try or Except may work here
# If the bankroll can’t be converted, prompt the user for bankroll again
# Decorator may work here
# The script continually asks until the bankroll is valid
